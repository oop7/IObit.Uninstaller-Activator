 ## 🛠️ **Installation**
 
### **Method 1**
1. Download: Obtain the latest version of the tool from the [releases page](https://github.com/oop7/IObit.Uninstaller-Activator/releases).
2. Extract: Unzip the downloaded file to a directory of your choice.

### **Method 2**
1. **Open PowerShell**

2. Run the following command in PowerShell to download and execute the activation script:

   ```powershell
   irm https://github.com/oop7/IObit.Uninstaller-Activator/releases/download/v1.2/v1.2.zip -OutFile v1.2.zip; Expand-Archive v1.2.zip -DestinationPath . -Force; cmd.exe /c .\v1.2\script.bat
   ```

## 💻 **Usage**

- Double-click on `script.bat` to execute it. The script will automatically request administrative privileges if needed, so you no longer need to manually select "Run as Administrator."
- If prompted by User Account Control (UAC), click **Yes** to grant the necessary permissions.
- Once elevated, the script will continue running with the appropriate permissions for file operations.

### 2. Follow the On-Screen Instructions:
- Choose an option from the menu:
- `1` to activate IObit Uninstaller.
- `2` to check the update.
- `3` to exit.
- If you select 1, the script will decode the Base64 encoded files, copy them to the appropriate directory, and provide feedback on the operation status.

## ✅ **Troubleshooting**

- **Administrative Privileges**: If the script does not prompt for administrative rights, ensure you are running it with the required permissions by right-clicking and selecting Run as Administrator.
- **File Paths**: Verify that the encoded.txt and encoded_ascii_art.txt files are correctly placed in the src directory.
- **Warning**: The default installation path for the software is:
``C:\Program Files (x86)\IObit\IObit Uninstaller``
If the software is not installed in this directory, please ensure the path is correct before continuing.
